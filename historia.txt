Think you were my leader?
Park, don't pay the meter
I'm a no way no how chick for a cheater
If you got some little problems
I suggest you solve them
I tune out when you criticize about all the involvement
I get in my car then I drive away
Then you're tryna race me all up on the freeway
Two girls in the back seat, that's a threeway
I don't wanna talk about it
My phone ain't prepaid
Doing what we want to, hanging out the window
Full tank, looking like who knows what we'll run into
Shaking up the toys in the gum dispensers
Every day's a struggle, every night's adventure
Let's go back to basics, let's forget the issue
Quit bitchin bout it and using up all the tissues
Let's just smoke some shit and well get some new shoes
I don't go shit to talk and I don't got shit to do.
